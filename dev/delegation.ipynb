So later on, we might decide to change the default author to \"Rachel\", so we change the definition in `WebPage.__init__`. But we forget to do the same in `ProductPage`, and now we have a bug! When writing the [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) library I've created bugs many times in this way, and sometimes they've been extremely hard to track down, because differences in deep learning hyper-parameters can have very subtle and hard to test or detect implications.\n",

    "The key to this approach is the use of `**kwargs`. In python `**kwargs` in a parameter like means \"put any additional keyword arguments into a dict called `kwarg`. And `**kwargs` in an argument list means \"insert all key/value pairs in the `kwargs` dict as named arguments here\". This approach is used in many popular libraries, such as `matplotlib`, in which the main `plot` function simply has the signature `plot(*args, **kwargs)`. The [plot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot) says \"*The `kwargs` are Line2D properties*\" and then lists those properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not just python that uses this approach. For instance, in the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) the equivalent to `**args` is simply written `...` (an *ellipsis*). The R documentation [explains](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#The-three-dots-argument): \"*Another frequent requirement is to allow one function to pass on argument settings to another. For example many graphics functions use the function par() and functions like plot() allow the user to pass on graphical parameters to par() to control the graphical output.This can be done by including an extra argument, literally ‘…’, of the function, which may then be passed on*\".\n",

    "However, this makes our API quite difficult to work with, because now the environment we're using for editing our Python code (examples in this article assume we're using Jupyter Notebook) doesn't know what parameters are available, so things like tab-completion of parameter names popup lists of signatures won't work. In addition, if we're using an automatic tool for generating API documentation (such as fastai's [show_doc](https://docs.fast.ai/gen_doc.nbdoc.html#show_doc) or [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), our docs won't include the full list of parameters, and we'll need to manually add information about these *delegated parameters* (i.e. `category`, `date`, and `author`, in this case). In fact, we've seen this already, in matplotlib's documentation for `plot`.\n",
