) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through xxup xxunk xxmaj box xxunk . xxmaj this would be a pretty thin xxunk to base an entire film on , except that xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is xxunk xxunk - out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters , from the xxunk but lonely xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek ( frank xxmaj morgan ) himself , who learns that his shop really is his home ; xxmaj xxunk ( felix xxmaj xxunk ) , xxmaj kralik 's sidekick and friend who always xxunk out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion ; xxunk pimp - du - xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( joseph xxmaj xxunk ) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a xxunk righteous xxmaj kralik ; and ambitious xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( william xxmaj tracy ) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of xxunk for xxmaj matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. xxmaj the xxunk love story between ' dear xxmaj friends ' is played out in this little shop in xxmaj budapest , xxmaj hungary , in which xxmaj kralik 's xxunk xxunk and subsequent xxunk to shop manager help the two xxunk - to - be along . xxmaj it 's nice that everyone gets a story in this film ; the supporting characters are well - developed , and xxmaj matuschek 's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one xxmaj alfred and xxmaj clara share . xxmaj his xxunk to new xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk ( charles xxmaj smith ) for xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve dinner , made in the xxunk , beautiful snow of a xxmaj hungarian winter , makes the audience glad that he is not alone ; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it is n't this film 's business to tell . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from the love story , i must say that xxmaj james xxmaj stewart is truly one of the best things about this film . xxmaj he does n't play the full - xxunk xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart persona in this film ( c / f ' mr xxmaj smith xxmaj goes xxmaj to xxmaj washington ' for that ) ; in fact xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik is xxunk and abrupt and not particularly kind . xxmaj he 's rather a xxunk man , in fact , with little hint ( until , perhaps , the very end ) of the xxunk - xxunk down - home xxunk charm xxmaj stewart would soon come to xxunk . xxmaj when he finds out before xxmaj clara that they have been xxunk in secret , in fact , xxmaj kralik does n't ' xxunk up -- he xxunk it out to see how far he can take the xxunk , especially since he quickly realises ( given his stormy relationship with xxmaj clara as boss and xxunk ) that loving the person he knows through the xxunk letters might not xxunk with loving the person herself . xxmaj his description to xxmaj clara of the fictional xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( what a name ! ) who was to become her xxunk is hilarious in the extreme , but also his way of proving that the letters do n't reveal all there is to a man , just as her letters do n't reveal all there is to her . xxmaj stewart plays this role perfectly -- he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever xxmaj clara insults xxmaj mr . xxmaj kralik , as she is often wo nt to do , even ( and especially ) to his face . xxmaj and yet one believes , underneath the xxunk and xxunk , that he * could * reveal his identity with as much xxunk and xxunk and sheer * hope * as he eventually does . \\n\\n xxmaj special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well . xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk xxunk rather less well in the first half of the film , but she really comes into her own in the closing - shop scene on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve , when she almost gets her heart broken again by xxmaj alfred 's most vivid description of her xxunk xxunk . xxmaj frank xxmaj morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek driven to nervous breakdown , the man who has to xxunk his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to ' grow old with him ' . xxmaj and xxmaj felix xxmaj xxunk plays the role of the meek but xxunk xxmaj xxunk wonderfully ( a xxmaj lubitsch regular , since he appears as a hilarious xxmaj russian xxunk in xxunk particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend xxmaj alfred get the xxmaj christmas present the latter * really * wants â€¦ a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box xxmaj clara is so hung up on . \\n\\n xxmaj xxunk xxmaj lubitsch really does himself proud with this film -- for example , the famously xxunk and xxunk care given to detail in the creation of the xxmaj matuschek shop is well worth the effort , right down to the xxmaj hungarian names on the door , the xxunk and the cash xxunk and so on . xxmaj but even though xxmaj lubitsch chose to have the story set in xxmaj hungary , the setting is actually universal : it could happen anywhere ; it could happen to you . xxmaj xxunk lies the charm of this simple story , these believable characters who really * are * people . xxmaj the snow on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve is real as well , or at least as real as xxmaj lubitsch could make it ( he had snow machines brought in at great expense ) . xxmaj it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable , that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that can not be xxunk . ( no , not even in a remake like xxup you 've xxup got xxup mail . ) \\n\\n * this * is really the xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart xxmaj christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about xxup it 's a xxup wonderful xxup life . xxmaj not to xxunk from the merits of that other film , but there 'd be no harm , and in fact a lot of good , done in watching xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner this xxmaj christmas instead . xxmaj it 's sweet , funny , charming , and xxmaj stewart is xxunk in his role . xxmaj we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film ; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could .</td>\n",

xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \\n\\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \\n\\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the \" revolutionaries \" , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that \" ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time \" . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant \" revolutionaries \" , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's \" woods \" and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( \" i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \\n\\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \\n\\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was \" uneven \" , xxmaj part2 actually \" goes rapidly downhill \" from there , \" xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail \" , which \" â€¦ feels almost unbearably slow and turgid \" . \\n\\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>\n",

) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through xxup xxunk xxmaj box xxunk . xxmaj this would be a pretty thin xxunk to base an entire film on , except that xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is xxunk xxunk - out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters , from the xxunk but lonely xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek ( frank xxmaj morgan ) himself , who learns that his shop really is his home ; xxmaj xxunk ( felix xxmaj xxunk ) , xxmaj kralik 's sidekick and friend who always xxunk out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion ; xxunk pimp - du - xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( joseph xxmaj xxunk ) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a xxunk righteous xxmaj kralik ; and ambitious xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( william xxmaj tracy ) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of xxunk for xxmaj matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. xxmaj the xxunk love story between ' dear xxmaj friends ' is played out in this little shop in xxmaj budapest , xxmaj hungary , in which xxmaj kralik 's xxunk xxunk and subsequent xxunk to shop manager help the two xxunk - to - be along . xxmaj it 's nice that everyone gets a story in this film ; the supporting characters are well - developed , and xxmaj matuschek 's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one xxmaj alfred and xxmaj clara share . xxmaj his xxunk to new xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk ( charles xxmaj smith ) for xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve dinner , made in the xxunk , beautiful snow of a xxmaj hungarian winter , makes the audience glad that he is not alone ; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it is n't this film 's business to tell . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from the love story , i must say that xxmaj james xxmaj stewart is truly one of the best things about this film . xxmaj he does n't play the full - xxunk xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart persona in this film ( c / f ' mr xxmaj smith xxmaj goes xxmaj to xxmaj washington ' for that ) ; in fact xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik is xxunk and abrupt and not particularly kind . xxmaj he 's rather a xxunk man , in fact , with little hint ( until , perhaps , the very end ) of the xxunk - xxunk down - home xxunk charm xxmaj stewart would soon come to xxunk . xxmaj when he finds out before xxmaj clara that they have been xxunk in secret , in fact , xxmaj kralik does n't ' xxunk up -- he xxunk it out to see how far he can take the xxunk , especially since he quickly realises ( given his stormy relationship with xxmaj clara as boss and xxunk ) that loving the person he knows through the xxunk letters might not xxunk with loving the person herself . xxmaj his description to xxmaj clara of the fictional xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( what a name ! ) who was to become her xxunk is hilarious in the extreme , but also his way of proving that the letters do n't reveal all there is to a man , just as her letters do n't reveal all there is to her . xxmaj stewart plays this role perfectly -- he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever xxmaj clara insults xxmaj mr . xxmaj kralik , as she is often wo nt to do , even ( and especially ) to his face . xxmaj and yet one believes , underneath the xxunk and xxunk , that he * could * reveal his identity with as much xxunk and xxunk and sheer * hope * as he eventually does . \\n\\n xxmaj special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well . xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk xxunk rather less well in the first half of the film , but she really comes into her own in the closing - shop scene on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve , when she almost gets her heart broken again by xxmaj alfred 's most vivid description of her xxunk xxunk . xxmaj frank xxmaj morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek driven to nervous breakdown , the man who has to xxunk his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to ' grow old with him ' . xxmaj and xxmaj felix xxmaj xxunk plays the role of the meek but xxunk xxmaj xxunk wonderfully ( a xxmaj lubitsch regular , since he appears as a hilarious xxmaj russian xxunk in xxunk particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend xxmaj alfred get the xxmaj christmas present the latter * really * wants â€¦ a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box xxmaj clara is so hung up on . \\n\\n xxmaj xxunk xxmaj lubitsch really does himself proud with this film -- for example , the famously xxunk and xxunk care given to detail in the creation of the xxmaj matuschek shop is well worth the effort , right down to the xxmaj hungarian names on the door , the xxunk and the cash xxunk and so on . xxmaj but even though xxmaj lubitsch chose to have the story set in xxmaj hungary , the setting is actually universal : it could happen anywhere ; it could happen to you . xxmaj xxunk lies the charm of this simple story , these believable characters who really * are * people . xxmaj the snow on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve is real as well , or at least as real as xxmaj lubitsch could make it ( he had snow machines brought in at great expense ) . xxmaj it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable , that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that can not be xxunk . ( no , not even in a remake like xxup you 've xxup got xxup mail . ) \\n\\n * this * is really the xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart xxmaj christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about xxup it 's a xxup wonderful xxup life . xxmaj not to xxunk from the merits of that other film , but there 'd be no harm , and in fact a lot of good , done in watching xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner this xxmaj christmas instead . xxmaj it 's sweet , funny , charming , and xxmaj stewart is xxunk in his role . xxmaj we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film ; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could .</td>\n",

) seem to suddenly be xxmaj soderbergh 's main challenge . xxmaj strange , after xxunk years in the business . xxmaj he was probably never much good at narrative , just xxunk it well inside \" edgy \" projects . \\n\\n xxmaj none of this excuses him this present , almost diabolical failure . xxmaj as xxmaj david xxmaj stratton xxunk , \" two parts of xxmaj che do n't ( even ) make a whole \" . \\n\\n xxmaj epic xxunk in name only , xxmaj che(2008 ) barely qualifies as a feature film ! xxmaj it certainly has no legs , xxunk as except for its xxunk ultimate resolution forced upon it by history , xxmaj soderbergh 's xxunk - long xxunk just goes nowhere . \\n\\n xxmaj even xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk , the more xxunk of xxmaj australia 's xxmaj at xxmaj the xxmaj movies duo , noted about xxmaj soderbergh 's xxunk waste of ( xxunk digital xxunk ) : \" you 're in the woods â€¦ you 're in the woods â€¦ you 're in the woods â€¦ \" . i too am surprised xxmaj soderbergh did n't give us another xxunk of xxup that somewhere between his xxunk two xxmaj parts , because he still left out massive xxunk of xxmaj che 's \" xxunk \" life ! \\n\\n xxmaj for a xxunk of an important but infamous historical figure , xxmaj soderbergh xxunk xxunk , if not deliberately insults , his audiences by \\n\\n 1 . never providing most of xxmaj che 's story ; \\n\\n 2 . xxunk xxunk film xxunk with mere xxunk xxunk ; \\n\\n 3 . xxunk both true hindsight and a narrative of events ; \\n\\n 4 . barely developing an idea , or a character ; \\n\\n 5 . remaining xxunk episodic ; \\n\\n 6 . xxunk proper context for scenes xxrep 3 - whatever we do get is xxunk in xxunk xxunk ; \\n\\n 7 . xxunk xxunk all audiences ( even xxmaj spanish - xxunk will be confused by the xxunk xxunk in xxmaj english ) ; and \\n\\n 8 . xxunk xxunk his main subject into one dimension . xxmaj why , at xxup this late stage ? xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \\n\\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \\n\\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the \" revolutionaries \" , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that \" ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time \" . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant \" revolutionaries \" , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's \" woods \" and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( \" i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \\n\\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \\n\\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was \" uneven \" , xxmaj part2 actually \" goes rapidly downhill \" from there , \" xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail \" , which \" â€¦ feels almost unbearably slow and turgid \" . \\n\\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>\n",

xxmaj very sad . \\n\\n xxmaj also , i just thought that xxmaj i d point something mentioned on the message xxunk which i felt was actually true : the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys . \\n\\n xxmaj do n't get me wrong , xxmaj i m not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring , as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute . xxmaj it 's just that overall they were just xxup blah compared to the men you 'd see on shows like a xxmaj shot xxmaj at xxmaj love with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk . \\n\\n i do n't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show . i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box , i can accept the xxunk , xxunk suitors but xxup please for the love of xxmaj god entertain me just a little . xxmaj no such luck . \\n\\n xxmaj if you 're expecting drama , intrigue , xxunk , or excitement you will be xxup severely disappointed . xxmaj the biggest \" drama \" comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in xxmaj new xxmaj york ( how xxunk ! ) . xxmaj as xxunk as that may be i guarantee you , that is the xxup only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show . \\n\\n xxmaj sure there is the twist , but if you have any semblance of xxmaj xxunk in you , you 'll easily xxunk who 's who ( it was n't hard at all , i was only wrong once . ) xxmaj this show is stacking so much of its xxunk on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else . \\n\\n xxmaj we get to watch as xxmaj james &amp; xxmaj co xxunk along such exciting activities such as learning how to xxmaj western step dance , shopping for xxunk , visiting a xxunk xxunk , and gay xxunk . xxup yawn . xxmaj sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway . xxmaj that 's one of main problems with the show : xxup no xxup one seems to be enjoying themselves -- they are there just going through the motion trying xxunk hard to appear to have a good time . xxmaj and you really ca nt blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame . \\n\\n xxmaj finally , the physical aspect is not there . xxmaj there 's no xxunk , no xxunk , no kissing ( ! ) , no xxunk of any sort . xxmaj it 's just \" ok that was a boring date , xxmaj i m gon na go back to my ugly , tacky wanna - be xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk dwelling ( quick xxunk on the lips ) xxup xxunk . \" xxmaj this show is so xxrep 4 * xxunk xxunk it 's ridiculous . i can understand them not wanting to play up the xxunk xxunk nature of homosexual men , but come the xxrep 4 * on . xxmaj people who watch reality xxup tv shows are gon na want more than xxunk xxunk and xxunk kisses . xxmaj this show refuses to compromise . \\n\\n xxmaj sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be xxunk . i do commend xxmaj bravo for first putting up a show of this nature , but the xxunk incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind xxunk . xxmaj to summarize my three points : xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring = go do something else . xxmaj you 'll have more fun waiting at a doctor 's office for an xxunk , at least they have interesting xxunk there .</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos xxmaj many neglect that this is n't just a classic due to the fact that it 's the first 3d game , or even the first xxunk - up . xxmaj it 's also one of the first xxunk games , one of the xxunk definitely the first ) truly claustrophobic games , and just a pretty well - xxunk gaming experience in general . xxmaj with graphics that are terribly dated today , the game xxunk you into the role of xxunk even * think * xxmaj i 'm going to attempt spelling his last name ! ) , an xxmaj american xxup xxunk . caught in an underground bunker . xxmaj you fight and search your way through xxunk in order to achieve different xxunk for the six xxunk , let 's face it , most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon , xxunk you with xxmaj nazis and send you out to waste one of the xxmaj nazi xxunk ) . xxmaj the graphics are , as i mentioned before , quite dated and very simple . xxmaj the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators . xxmaj if you can get over that , xxunk some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you ) , then you 've got one heck of a good shooter / xxunk game . xxmaj the game play consists of searching for keys , health and ammo , xxunk xxunk xxmaj nazis , and a \" boss enemy \" per chapter ) of varying xxunk , of course , grows as you move further in the game ) , xxunk doors and looking for secret rooms . xxmaj there is a bonus count after each level is beaten â€¦ it goes by how fast you xxunk , if you beat the ' par time ' , which is the time it took a xxunk to go through the same level ; this can be quite fun to try and beat , and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in , they are even xxunk after many play - xxunk ) , how much xxmaj nazi xxunk ) you xxunk and how many bad guys you killed . xxmaj basically , if you got 100 % of any of aforementioned , you get a bonus , helping you reach the xxunk high score xxunk . xxmaj the game ( mostly , but not always ) allows for two xxunk different methods of playing â€¦ xxunk or xxunk down anything and everything you see . xxmaj you can either run or walk , and amongst your weapons is also a knife â€¦ running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard , as is xxunk . xxmaj many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you , meaning that you can walk up behind them and xxunk them â€¦ nearly silently . xxmaj in your xxunk , you can get no less than four weapons and two keys â€¦ more about the weapons later . xxmaj the keys xxunk certain doors . xxmaj most doors in the game are n't locked â€¦ only two kinds need keys , and these keys are only introduced in later xxunk xxunk in levels , xxunk weaponry , health , score and lives in each chapter ) . xxmaj much of the later game is spent looking for them . xxmaj now , as i just alluded to , this game , like many of the xxunk 80 's , early 90 's ) , is based on xxunk extra lives â€¦ personally , i think it 's completely and utterly xxunk was mercifully dropped from here on end â€¦ i think ( ? ) , from the next 3d shooter and xxunk ) , since you can save anytime you want and ' using a life ' xxunk weaponry , health and ammo , like starting on a new xxunk is a real pain in later levels , where you * need * xxunk artillery ) . xxmaj now , i shall beat around the bush no longer â€¦ moving on to the guns ! xxmaj you start with aforementioned xxunk is silent but only effective up close ) and a xxunk â€¦ nothing special , but good for xxunk ammo , unlike the next two bad boys . xxmaj your third weapon is a xxmaj german xxup xxunk â€¦ a sub - machine - gun . xxmaj it 's faster and automatic , and some later enemies use it . xxmaj and the last one â€¦ is nothing short of a xxmaj xxunk gun ! xxmaj oh yeah ! xxmaj think xxup xxunk . xxmaj think xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj think about xxunk massive xxunk of lead into xxmaj nazi xxunk with such a gun . xxmaj it 's every bit as entertaining as it sounds . xxmaj most of the boss enemies use this , though , so be prepared . i wo n't reveal the identities of these boss enemies , however â€¦ that 's for each player to discover for xxunk xxunk . xxmaj the sound is excellent â€¦ very crisp and realistic . xxmaj as you hear the tear of a machine - gun firing , the xxunk xxunk xxunk of a door slamming shut behind you or a xxmaj nazi yelling surprised or a warning in xxmaj german , you truly feel like you are there , trapped in these dark and depressing bunker xxunk . xxmaj that xxunk me nicely into the level design â€¦ as you run through seemingly countless , nearly identical xxunk towards the next elevator leading you further , you are xxunk by the claustrophobic mood . i almost got motion sickness more than xxunk that might also have something to do with little sleep , lots of xxunk and unusual xxunk â€¦ ) from playing . xxmaj though the level of detail is n't terribly high , what there is is great . xxmaj remains of victims , guards ' quarters and countless xxmaj nazi xxunk â€¦ the list goes on . xxmaj the game also features quite a bit of gore â€¦ for it 's limited graphics engine , xxmaj john xxmaj romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game . xxmaj what is there left to say â€¦ the first of its kind , and it 's no wonder this xxunk countless others 3d xxunk . xxmaj sure , weapon xxunk and different height xxunk and such ) did n't come around until the next entry into the genre â€¦ xxmaj doom â€¦ and it was xxmaj duke xxmaj xxunk 3d that introduced the feature of switching your xxunk it goes beyond simply left and right , adding xxunk xxunk to it ) , and jumping did n't come around until a third , later xxunk first xxmaj xxunk , possibly ? xxmaj fellow xxunk , help me out here ) â€¦ but all of those games , as well as the rest of the genre , owe their existence to this one . xxmaj so load up the xxmaj xxunk , open the door to enter the bunker and step into xxunk . 's shoes â€¦ he deserves the recognition , xxunk maybe even especially ? ) nearly fifteen years after he first appeared . i recommended this to all fans of 3d games . 8 / 10</td>\n",
