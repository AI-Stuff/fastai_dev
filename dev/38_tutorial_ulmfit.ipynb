) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through xxup xxunk xxmaj box xxunk . xxmaj this would be a pretty thin xxunk to base an entire film on , except that xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is xxunk xxunk - out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters , from the xxunk but lonely xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek ( frank xxmaj morgan ) himself , who learns that his shop really is his home ; xxmaj xxunk ( felix xxmaj xxunk ) , xxmaj kralik 's sidekick and friend who always xxunk out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion ; xxunk pimp - du - xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( joseph xxmaj xxunk ) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a xxunk righteous xxmaj kralik ; and ambitious xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( william xxmaj tracy ) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of xxunk for xxmaj matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. xxmaj the xxunk love story between ' dear xxmaj friends ' is played out in this little shop in xxmaj budapest , xxmaj hungary , in which xxmaj kralik 's xxunk xxunk and subsequent xxunk to shop manager help the two xxunk - to - be along . xxmaj it 's nice that everyone gets a story in this film ; the supporting characters are well - developed , and xxmaj matuschek 's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one xxmaj alfred and xxmaj clara share . xxmaj his xxunk to new xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk ( charles xxmaj smith ) for xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve dinner , made in the xxunk , beautiful snow of a xxmaj hungarian winter , makes the audience glad that he is not alone ; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it is n't this film 's business to tell . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from the love story , i must say that xxmaj james xxmaj stewart is truly one of the best things about this film . xxmaj he does n't play the full - xxunk xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart persona in this film ( c / f ' mr xxmaj smith xxmaj goes xxmaj to xxmaj washington ' for that ) ; in fact xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik is xxunk and abrupt and not particularly kind . xxmaj he 's rather a xxunk man , in fact , with little hint ( until , perhaps , the very end ) of the xxunk - xxunk down - home xxunk charm xxmaj stewart would soon come to xxunk . xxmaj when he finds out before xxmaj clara that they have been xxunk in secret , in fact , xxmaj kralik does n't ' xxunk up -- he xxunk it out to see how far he can take the xxunk , especially since he quickly realises ( given his stormy relationship with xxmaj clara as boss and xxunk ) that loving the person he knows through the xxunk letters might not xxunk with loving the person herself . xxmaj his description to xxmaj clara of the fictional xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( what a name ! ) who was to become her xxunk is hilarious in the extreme , but also his way of proving that the letters do n't reveal all there is to a man , just as her letters do n't reveal all there is to her . xxmaj stewart plays this role perfectly -- he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever xxmaj clara insults xxmaj mr . xxmaj kralik , as she is often wo nt to do , even ( and especially ) to his face . xxmaj and yet one believes , underneath the xxunk and xxunk , that he * could * reveal his identity with as much xxunk and xxunk and sheer * hope * as he eventually does . \\n\\n xxmaj special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well . xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk xxunk rather less well in the first half of the film , but she really comes into her own in the closing - shop scene on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve , when she almost gets her heart broken again by xxmaj alfred 's most vivid description of her xxunk xxunk . xxmaj frank xxmaj morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek driven to nervous breakdown , the man who has to xxunk his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to ' grow old with him ' . xxmaj and xxmaj felix xxmaj xxunk plays the role of the meek but xxunk xxmaj xxunk wonderfully ( a xxmaj lubitsch regular , since he appears as a hilarious xxmaj russian xxunk in xxunk particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend xxmaj alfred get the xxmaj christmas present the latter * really * wants … a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box xxmaj clara is so hung up on . \\n\\n xxmaj xxunk xxmaj lubitsch really does himself proud with this film -- for example , the famously xxunk and xxunk care given to detail in the creation of the xxmaj matuschek shop is well worth the effort , right down to the xxmaj hungarian names on the door , the xxunk and the cash xxunk and so on . xxmaj but even though xxmaj lubitsch chose to have the story set in xxmaj hungary , the setting is actually universal : it could happen anywhere ; it could happen to you . xxmaj xxunk lies the charm of this simple story , these believable characters who really * are * people . xxmaj the snow on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve is real as well , or at least as real as xxmaj lubitsch could make it ( he had snow machines brought in at great expense ) . xxmaj it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable , that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that can not be xxunk . ( no , not even in a remake like xxup you 've xxup got xxup mail . ) \\n\\n * this * is really the xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart xxmaj christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about xxup it 's a xxup wonderful xxup life . xxmaj not to xxunk from the merits of that other film , but there 'd be no harm , and in fact a lot of good , done in watching xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner this xxmaj christmas instead . xxmaj it 's sweet , funny , charming , and xxmaj stewart is xxunk in his role . xxmaj we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film ; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could .</td>\n",

xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \\n\\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \\n\\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the \" revolutionaries \" , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that \" ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time \" . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant \" revolutionaries \" , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's \" woods \" and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( \" i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \\n\\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \\n\\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was \" uneven \" , xxmaj part2 actually \" goes rapidly downhill \" from there , \" xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail \" , which \" … feels almost unbearably slow and turgid \" . \\n\\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is one of the xxunk and most feel - good romantic comedies ever made . xxmaj there 's just no getting around that , and it 's hard to actually put one 's feeling for this film into words . xxmaj it 's not one of those films that tries too hard , nor does it come up with the xxunk possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end . xxmaj in fact , all its charm is xxunk , contained within the characters and the setting and the plot … which is highly believable to xxunk . xxmaj it 's easy to think that such a love story , as beautiful as any other ever told , * could * happen to you … a feeling you do n't often get from other romantic comedies , however sweet and heart - warming they may be . \\n\\n xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik ( james xxmaj stewart ) and xxmaj clara xxmaj xxunk ( margaret xxmaj xxunk ) do n't have the most xxunk of first xxunk when she arrives in the shop ( matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. ) he 's been working in for the past nine years , asking for a job . xxmaj they clash from the very beginning , mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it 's opened -- he thinks it 's a ludicrous idea ; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired . xxmaj their bickering takes them through the next six months , even as they both ( xxunk , of course ! ) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through xxup xxunk xxmaj box xxunk . xxmaj this would be a pretty thin xxunk to base an entire film on , except that xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is xxunk xxunk - out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters , from the xxunk but lonely xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek ( frank xxmaj morgan ) himself , who learns that his shop really is his home ; xxmaj xxunk ( felix xxmaj xxunk ) , xxmaj kralik 's sidekick and friend who always xxunk out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion ; xxunk pimp - du - xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( joseph xxmaj xxunk ) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a xxunk righteous xxmaj kralik ; and ambitious xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( william xxmaj tracy ) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of xxunk for xxmaj matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. xxmaj the xxunk love story between ' dear xxmaj friends ' is played out in this little shop in xxmaj budapest , xxmaj hungary , in which xxmaj kralik 's xxunk xxunk and subsequent xxunk to shop manager help the two xxunk - to - be along . xxmaj it 's nice that everyone gets a story in this film ; the supporting characters are well - developed , and xxmaj matuschek 's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one xxmaj alfred and xxmaj clara share . xxmaj his xxunk to new xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk ( charles xxmaj smith ) for xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve dinner , made in the xxunk , beautiful snow of a xxmaj hungarian winter , makes the audience glad that he is not alone ; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it is n't this film 's business to tell . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from the love story , i must say that xxmaj james xxmaj stewart is truly one of the best things about this film . xxmaj he does n't play the full - xxunk xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart persona in this film ( c / f ' mr xxmaj smith xxmaj goes xxmaj to xxmaj washington ' for that ) ; in fact xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik is xxunk and abrupt and not particularly kind . xxmaj he 's rather a xxunk man , in fact , with little hint ( until , perhaps , the very end ) of the xxunk - xxunk down - home xxunk charm xxmaj stewart would soon come to xxunk . xxmaj when he finds out before xxmaj clara that they have been xxunk in secret , in fact , xxmaj kralik does n't ' xxunk up -- he xxunk it out to see how far he can take the xxunk , especially since he quickly realises ( given his stormy relationship with xxmaj clara as boss and xxunk ) that loving the person he knows through the xxunk letters might not xxunk with loving the person herself . xxmaj his description to xxmaj clara of the fictional xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( what a name ! ) who was to become her xxunk is hilarious in the extreme , but also his way of proving that the letters do n't reveal all there is to a man , just as her letters do n't reveal all there is to her . xxmaj stewart plays this role perfectly -- he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever xxmaj clara insults xxmaj mr . xxmaj kralik , as she is often wo nt to do , even ( and especially ) to his face . xxmaj and yet one believes , underneath the xxunk and xxunk , that he * could * reveal his identity with as much xxunk and xxunk and sheer * hope * as he eventually does . \\n\\n xxmaj special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well . xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk xxunk rather less well in the first half of the film , but she really comes into her own in the closing - shop scene on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve , when she almost gets her heart broken again by xxmaj alfred 's most vivid description of her xxunk xxunk . xxmaj frank xxmaj morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek driven to nervous breakdown , the man who has to xxunk his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to ' grow old with him ' . xxmaj and xxmaj felix xxmaj xxunk plays the role of the meek but xxunk xxmaj xxunk wonderfully ( a xxmaj lubitsch regular , since he appears as a hilarious xxmaj russian xxunk in xxunk particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend xxmaj alfred get the xxmaj christmas present the latter * really * wants … a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box xxmaj clara is so hung up on . \\n\\n xxmaj xxunk xxmaj lubitsch really does himself proud with this film -- for example , the famously xxunk and xxunk care given to detail in the creation of the xxmaj matuschek shop is well worth the effort , right down to the xxmaj hungarian names on the door , the xxunk and the cash xxunk and so on . xxmaj but even though xxmaj lubitsch chose to have the story set in xxmaj hungary , the setting is actually universal : it could happen anywhere ; it could happen to you . xxmaj xxunk lies the charm of this simple story , these believable characters who really * are * people . xxmaj the snow on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve is real as well , or at least as real as xxmaj lubitsch could make it ( he had snow machines brought in at great expense ) . xxmaj it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable , that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that can not be xxunk . ( no , not even in a remake like xxup you 've xxup got xxup mail . ) \\n\\n * this * is really the xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart xxmaj christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about xxup it 's a xxup wonderful xxup life . xxmaj not to xxunk from the merits of that other film , but there 'd be no harm , and in fact a lot of good , done in watching xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner this xxmaj christmas instead . xxmaj it 's sweet , funny , charming , and xxmaj stewart is xxunk in his role . xxmaj we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film ; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could .</td>\n",

xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \\n\\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \\n\\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the \" revolutionaries \" , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that \" ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time \" . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant \" revolutionaries \" , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's \" woods \" and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( \" i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \\n\\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \\n\\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was \" uneven \" , xxmaj part2 actually \" goes rapidly downhill \" from there , \" xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail \" , which \" … feels almost unbearably slow and turgid \" . \\n\\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>\n",

( i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1 xxrep 3 0 words ) … and they make love to each other . \\n\\n xxmaj we next follow xxmaj anna , who is sitting at a lunch stand . xxmaj her boyfriend , xxmaj nick ( adrian xxmaj xxunk ) , enters , bearing xxunk . xxmaj she is cold toward him ; he tries to figure out why . xxmaj he coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in xxmaj san xxmaj francisco . xxmaj she coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex - xxunk while in xxmaj san xxmaj francisco , and had sex with her . xxmaj the latter revelation turns out to be a lie . xxmaj the two of them make out in the xxunk , but she decides that they must break up . xxmaj nick is xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj and we follow xxmaj nick , who confesses his xxunk to an older woman who he meets on a park bench , xxmaj joey ( carol xxmaj kane ) . xxmaj joey is sort of weird and child - like , but is a good audience for xxmaj nick , who needs a sympathetic ear . xxmaj the two of them go to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj island at night , and look at the stars . xxmaj nick falls under xxmaj joey 's spell , despite the age difference between them . xxmaj they go back to xxmaj joey 's apartment , and xxmaj nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman . xxmaj she is on top of him , does n't want to let him go . xxmaj but he manages to escape . \\n\\n ( this is , by the way , the best xxmaj carol xxmaj kane role since she played xxmaj xxunk 's wife in xxmaj taxi . ) xxmaj joey 's phone rings , and it is a man calling the xxmaj psychic xxmaj friends xxmaj network , and xxmaj joey is one of the psychic friends . xxmaj although she is still hurting from xxmaj nick , she gradually gets into her psychic xxunk . xxmaj the man is at his office , late at night , and wants to have phone sex with her . xxmaj although that is not xxmaj joey 's business , xxmaj joey goes along , and coaxes the man to come . xxmaj she wants to keep talking , although the man want to get off the phone , and finds out that he has xxunk a lot of money from his company , and will be found out xxunk . xxmaj his life is ruined . xxmaj joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide , and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend , that she cares about him . xxmaj and she does care about him . \\n\\n xxmaj but the man packs a gun into his xxunk , and goes off to seek a prostitute on the xxmaj brooklyn xxunk , and we come back to the beginning , to the same prostitute who started out xxmaj la xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj she wants to give him $ xxunk , xxrep 3 0 in cash if she will kill him . xxmaj he tried to kill himself , but could n't do it . xxmaj the prostitute does not want to do it , but he insists , holding her hand , holding the gun inside his mouth , telling her where to aim . xxmaj eventually , the gun goes off , and we see the prostitute walking down the street , and xxunk at the corner where she normally does business . xxmaj the contractor who did n't pay her earlier in the movie drives up , xxunk down the window . xxmaj they look at each other . xxup the xxup end .</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos xxmaj i 'm sure things did n't exactly go the same way in the real life of xxmaj homer xxmaj hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book , xxmaj rocket xxmaj boys , but the movie \" october xxmaj sky \" ( an xxunk of the book 's title ) is good enough to stand alone . i have not read xxmaj hickam 's memoirs , but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation . xxmaj the film , directed by xxmaj joe xxmaj xxunk and written by xxmaj lewis xxmaj xxunk , xxunk the story of teenager xxmaj homer xxmaj hickam ( jake xxmaj xxunk ) , beginning in xxmaj october of 1957 . xxmaj it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast , bringing news of the xxmaj russian satellite xxmaj xxunk , the first artificial satellite in orbit . xxmaj we see a images of a blue - gray town and its people : mostly miners working for the xxmaj olga xxmaj coal xxmaj company . xxmaj one of the miners xxunk to the news on a hand - held radio as he enters the elevator xxunk , but the xxunk is lost as he disappears into the darkness , losing sight of the xxunk sky above him . a melancholy violin tune xxunk with this image . xxmaj we then get a xxunk of xxmaj xxunk on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting : xxmaj october 5 , 1957 , xxmaj coalwood , xxmaj west xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj homer and his buddies , xxmaj roy xxmaj lee xxmaj cook ( william xxmaj lee xxmaj scott ) and xxmaj xxunk o'dell ( chad xxmaj xxunk ) , are talking about football xxunk . xxmaj football xxunk are the only way out of the town , and working in the mines , for these boys . \" why are the xxunk the only ones who get to go to college , \" questions xxmaj homer . xxmaj roy xxmaj lee replies , \" they 're also the only ones who get the girls . \" xxmaj homer does n't make it in football like his older brother , so he is destined for the mines , and to follow in his father 's xxunk as mine xxunk . xxmaj until he sees the xxunk of light xxunk across the xxmaj october sky . xxmaj then he wants to build a rocket . \" i want to go into space , \" says xxmaj homer . xxmaj after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother 's ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) xxunk , xxmaj homer xxunk the help of the nerdy xxmaj quentin xxmaj wilson ( chris xxmaj owen ) . xxmaj quentin asks xxmaj homer , \" what do you want to know about rockets ? \" xxmaj homer quickly xxunk , \" everything . \" xxmaj his science teacher at xxmaj big xxmaj xxunk xxmaj high xxmaj school , xxmaj miss xxmaj xxunk xxmaj riley ( laura xxmaj xxunk ) greatly supports xxmaj homer , and the four boys work on building rockets in xxmaj homer 's basement . xxmaj his father , however , whose life is the mine , does not support him . xxmaj john xxmaj hickam ( chris xxmaj cooper ) believes that xxmaj homer should n't waste his time on the rockets , that the coal mines are all that matter . xxmaj the coal from the mines is used to make steel , and without steel , the country would be nothing . xxmaj the difficult relationship between xxmaj homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film . xxmaj miss xxmaj riley introduces xxmaj homer to the idea of entering the local science fair , with a chance to go the xxunk and win a college scholarship . \" you ca n't just dream your way out of xxmaj coalwood , \" she tells xxmaj homer . xxmaj homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets , xxunk the models with each attempt . xxmaj despite the many attempts , the boys do not lose their determination . \" what are the chances of us winning that science fair , \" o'dell asks xxmaj homer in one of their more xxunk moments . \" a million to one , \" answers xxmaj homer . \" that good ? \" o'dell replies , \" well , why did n't you say so ? \" xxmaj the music , composed by xxmaj mark xxmaj xxunk , conveys sadness and hope at the same time , especially sad at a point when xxmaj homer xxunk into the mine xxunk and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of xxmaj coalwood . xxmaj xxunk 1950s ' rock and roll , including songs by xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj buddy xxmaj xxunk , occasionally pushes the xxunk pieces aside to create a light - hearted mood that xxunk the teenagers ' lives with the lives of the miners . xxmaj the film , photographed by xxmaj fred xxmaj murphy , also uses colors to set xxunk and xxunk . xxmaj the town of xxmaj coalwood , actually filmed in xxmaj xxunk , is washed with blues , xxunk , and xxunk . xxmaj it 's as if the xxunk from the coal sticks to xxunk faces , clothes , houses , and roads . xxmaj when a couple in a xxunk red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys , it is obvious that they are from the world outside of xxmaj coalwood and the xxmaj olga xxmaj coal xxmaj company . xxmaj the book on xxunk xxunk design that xxmaj miss xxmaj riley gives xxmaj homer is red . xxmaj the red stands out enough against the blue - gray world of xxmaj coalwood to xxunk \" getting out \" , but it is still subtle . xxmaj the xxunk are xxunk hints of a world that xxmaj homer only dreams of . xxmaj jake xxmaj xxunk xxunk such xxunk , hope , and xxunk as xxmaj homer xxmaj hickam that it is hard to believe he is n't the real xxmaj homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film . xxmaj chris xxmaj cooper is also xxunk believable as xxmaj homer 's xxunk father , who does n't recognize , or just does n't want to admit , that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive . xxmaj homer , and everyone who encourages him in his rocket - building , is aware that the town is dying . xxmaj with the community xxunk , the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys ' xxunk . xxmaj again , xxmaj i 'm sure things did n't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them , but what would a movie be without a bit of xxunk ?
